# A report published by a survey agency on the number of female workers (in millions) 
# in each country revealed the following data. 
#
# For Western Europe, the values were as follows: 
#   - Germany: 86 
#   - Norway: 89 
#   - France: 72 
#   - Ireland: 77 
#   - Finland: 81 
#   - Greece: 85 
#   - United Kingdom: 89 
#   - Belgium: 73 
#   - Italy: 79 
#   - Denmark: 83 
#
# For Africa, the values reported were as follows: 
#   - Congo: 32 
#   - Sudan: 12 
#   - Botswana: 11 
#   - Kenya: 36 
#   - Ghana: 22 
#   - Zimbabwe: 27 
#   - Madagascar: 12 
#   - Zambia: 38

# a) Calculate the mean for the two sets of nations. Which
# set of nations has a higher number of female workers?

# b) Find the standard deviation for the two sets of nations.
# Which set has a larger spread of scores and why?

# from the ?help of geom_boxplot:
# In a notched box plot, the notches extend 1.58 * IQR / sqrt(n). 
# This gives a roughly 95% confidence interval for comparing medians. See McGill et al. (1978) for more details. 

# it is interesting to note that this is different from using SD.

# A report indicates that teacherâ€™s total annual pay
# (including bonuses) in Toronto, Ontario, has a mean of
# $61,000 and standard deviation of $10,000 (Canadian dollars).
# Suppose the distribution has approximately a bell shape.

# (a) Give an interval of values that contains about (i) 68%,
# (ii) 95%, (iii) all or nearly all salaries

# (b) Would a salary of $100,000 be unusual? Why?

# we do not know what the total population is, so we will use mean and sd only to calculate intervals with the Empirical Rule.
