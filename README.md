## ℹ️ About the course

This course introduces students to the necessary fundamentals of mathematics and statistics, and their applications, to conduct quantitative policy evaluations.
The course will provide a survey of theoretical foundational concepts and techniques. The applied part
of the course will focus on implementing these techniques in R, as well as developing the
practical skills in the language required to be able to independently conduct basic data analysis in research projects.

**Instructors:**  
Dr E. Keith Smith ([esmith@ethz.ch](mailto:esmith@ethz.ch))  
Camille Fournier de Lauriere ([cfournier@ethz.ch](mailto:cfournier@ethz.ch))

## 🎯 Learning objectives for the R practice.

By the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. How to use R and RStudio: General knowledge of the R language.
2. Implementing examples from the course: all content covered in the theoretical sections will be
exemplified in R.
3. Data handling fundamentals: how to work in the tidy ecosystem (tidyverse).
4. Data visualization fundamentals: learning about most common plots and how to implement them in R,
mainly using ggplot2.

## ⚙️ Setup

Please download and install R and RStudio before the first class.

## 📁 Repository Organization

The repository follows the structure of the course and is organized to help you navigate the lecture materials, datasets, and other files efficiently.

### Main folders

- **`01_introClass/`, `02_descriptives/`, `03_samplingDistributions/`, `05_hypothesisTesting/`, …**  
  These numbered folders correspond to lecture topics in chronological order.  
  Each contains the R scripts used in class and any potentially small datasets specific to that session.  
  Work through them sequentially — they build upon each other.

- **`ESSData/`**  
  Contains the datasets drawn from the *European Social Survey (ESS)*.  
  Includes CSV files for different countries and survey waves (8–10), along with their HTML codebooks.  

- **`generalFiles/`**  
  Contains reference materials such as the syllabus, formula sheet, and R cheatsheets (located in the `/cheatsheets/` subfolder).
